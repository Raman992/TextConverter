## My Journey (From Your About Page)

> "This is my first website built using React (Vite).  
> In this project, I used React with Bootstrap, which made UI design much easier and faster thanks to its prebuilt components and responsive utilities."

**Goal**: Keep learning React and build more interactive apps!  
This project helped me understand:
- React components & state
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Bootstrap + React synergy
- How to deploy with Vite
